>### Update Ukrainian localization in osu-stable.

> Greetings. I want to start with the fact that the **Ukrainian** community,
> since **2015** has been trying to get the only file on the server, with
> the localization strings weighing **133** kilobytes, updated. Since access
> to the previous localization file was lost, we, together with the
> **Ukrainian** community, decided to translate it again.

> On behalf of the entire **Ukrainian** community, we ask you to update one
> single static file on the server. To do this, you do not need to
> release a new version of the game, it is just a static file weighing
> **133** Kb, but **133** Kb that will let us know that we are not forgotten and
> that we are treated equally as other communities who have full
> translation.

> I know you say that you don't update the localization in the stable
> version anymore, and use a special service for this, but what is the
> cost to you to update one file on the server? I mean, there's probably
> something I don't know and maybe this process is more complicated than
> I think it is, so I won't say no to being told where and what I'm
> wrong.

> I really hope you understand, and that you understand that this is
> important to us, especially right now.
